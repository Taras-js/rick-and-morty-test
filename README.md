# Rick and morty test case app

## How to use this repo

Use the apollo server to create app

There are 2 main folders:

- `server`: The starting point of our GraphQL server.
- `client`: The starting point of our React application.

To get started:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server.

In another Terminal window,

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## What to do... what to do...

Part 1

1. Make fork off this app
2. Define the schema: Use mock data and structure schema to provide that data as intuitively as possible for card. Explore data for card here [front rick-and-morty app](https://rick-and-morty-frontcase.herokuapp.com/)
3. Backend implementation: build GraphQL API using Apollo Server and fetch the required data from whichever data sources contain it.
4. Frontend implementation: Our client consumes data from our GraphQL API to render its views.
5. Send us link to forked github repo.

To get bonus scores:

1. Deploy server app on heroku with Apollo Explorer Enabled - [example rick-and-morty server app](https://rick-and-morty-testcase.herokuapp.com/)
2. Deploy client app on heroku [front rick-and-morty app](https://rick-and-morty-frontcase.herokuapp.com/)
3. Send us a link to your github and implementation
